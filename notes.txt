App goals: create a drag and drop scheduler that places meals onto a weekly calendar. Meals placed on the schedule will compile a list of ingredients, which in turn will create a shopping list.

Create meal: user can create meals and input ingredients

Week: you can designate a shopping day and your week will start there

Day: includes # of meals toggle

Future functionality: users will log in, meals will be stored, ingredients will be listed by aisle and sorted to make shopping quicker, add in custom items
